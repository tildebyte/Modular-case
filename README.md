# Modular-case
Custom designed 9U, 84hp Eurorack case. Designed for TipTop Audio [Z-Rrails](http://www.tiptopaudio.com/zrails.php) and [Î¼Zeus](http://www.tiptopaudio.com/zeusmicro.php) Flying Bus Boards (i.e. **not** "hard" power bus boards. The design could easily (probably) be modified to include a back or bottom which would allow them).

Drafted with the unbelievably amazing [SolveSpace](http://solvespace.com/index.pl)

Laser cut job w/recommended material (~9.5mm birch ply) @ [Pololu](https://www.pololu.com/laserquote/1J39041/6f7e85a8)
